# WiZ Screen Sync

A small program written in Rust.

It reads the pixels in your screen and sets your WiZ lightbulbs to the average.

Good for immersive gaming and content consumption.

## Instructions
Set your lightbulbs' IPs in the `main.rs` file.

Press `ESC` to stop the program and restore the lightbuls to their previous setting.
